Included are several quizzes and my convex hull assignment. 

The convext hull assignment returns a list of indices describing a convex hull given a larger list of points in a 2-D plane. A convex hull is a "wrapper" for the points. Essentially, if I were to stretch a rubber band over all the points, and release it, the convex hull would be how the rubber band orients itself around the points.
